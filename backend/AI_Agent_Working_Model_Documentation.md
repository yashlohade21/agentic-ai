- **Scalability:** Single-instance deployment

### Optimization Opportunities

#### 1. Caching Strategy
```python
# Implement intelligent caching
class ResponseCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.ttl = 3600  # 1 hour
    
    async def get_cached_response(self, request_hash: str):
        """Retrieve cached response if available and valid"""
        if request_hash in self.cache:
            cached_item = self.cache[request_hash]
            if time.time() - cached_item['timestamp'] < self.ttl:
                return cached_item['response']
        return None
```

#### 2. Parallel Processing Enhancement
```python
# Optimize agent execution parallelism
async def execute_plan_optimized(self, plan: List[Dict[str, Any]]):
    """Execute plan with optimized parallelism"""
    # Group independent tasks for parallel execution
    # Note: build_dependency_graph and topological_sort are proposed functions to be implemented
    dependency_graph = self.build_dependency_graph(plan)
    execution_levels = self.topological_sort(dependency_graph)
    
    for level in execution_levels:
        # Execute all tasks in this level concurrently
        tasks = [self.execute_task(task) for task in level]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

#### 3. Resource Management
```python
# Implement resource pooling and management
class ResourceManager:
    def __init__(self):

        self.tool_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5)
    
    async def acquire_llm_connection(self):
        """Acquire LLM connection from pool"""
        return await self.llm_pool.acquire()
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Considerations

### Current Security Posture
- **API Key Management:** Environment variable based
- **Code Execution:** Limited sandboxing
- **Input Validation:** Basic validation in place
- **Data Privacy:** Local processing with external API calls

### Security Enhancement Recommendations

#### 1. Enhanced Input Validation
```python
# Comprehensive input sanitization
# Note: This is a basic approach - production systems should use more sophisticated validation
# Requires: re module
class InputValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_request_length = 10000
        self.forbidden_patterns = [
            r'__import__',
            r'eval\(',
            r'exec\(',
            r'subprocess',
        ]
    
    def validate_request(self, request: str) -> bool:
        """Validate user request for security"""
        if len(request) > self.max_request_length:
            raise ValueError("Request too long")
        
        for pattern in self.forbidden_patterns:
            if re.search(pattern, request, re.IGNORECASE):
                raise ValueError(f"Forbidden pattern detected: {pattern}")
        
        return True
```

#### 2. Code Execution Sandboxing
```python
# Secure code execution environment
class SecureCodeExecutor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.allowed_modules = ['math', 'datetime', 'json', 'random']
        self.timeout = 10
        self.memory_limit = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100MB
    
    async def execute_code(self, code: str) -> str:
        """Execute code in sandboxed environment"""
        # Use Docker container or similar for isolation
        # Implement resource limits and monitoring
```

#### 3. API Key Security
```python
# Enhanced API key management
class SecureKeyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.key_rotation_interval = 86400  # 24 hours
        self.encrypted_storage = EncryptedStorage()
    
    async def get_api_key(self, provider: str) -> str:
        """Retrieve API key with rotation support"""
        # Implement key rotation and encryption
```
